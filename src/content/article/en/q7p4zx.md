The world often jokes about how bad British food is, but in reality, 91% of Britons are satisfied with their traditional cuisine. However, when you dig deeper, there are actually more dishes people dislike than like.

In 2019, YouGov surveyed 6,367 British adults ([survey](https://yougov.co.uk/consumer/articles/23758-classic-british-cuisine-ranked-britons)), listing 30 classic savory British dishes. Yorkshire pudding topped the list with an 85% approval rating.

By category, there are 14 dishes in the "low score group" (approval below 60%), 9 in the "high score group" (above 70%), and 7 in the middle.

## Men’s and Women’s Most Loved and Hated Dishes

British men and women have slightly different favorites, but the gap isn’t huge.

| Men’s Favorites         | Women’s Favorites         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Fish and chips (85%)   | Yorkshire pudding (87%)  |
| Bacon sandwich (83%)   | Sunday roast (84%)       |
| Sunday roast (83%)     | Crumpets (83%)           |

At first glance, only Sunday roast is shared, but in fact, all these dishes have over 75% approval from the opposite gender—none are real deal-breakers.

| How Men Rate Women’s Favorites | How Women Rate Men’s Favorites |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Yorkshire pudding (83%)       | Fish and chips (82%)           |
| Sunday roast (83%)            | Bacon sandwich (76%)           |
| Crumpets (79%)                | Sunday roast (84%)             |

Overall, men tend to prefer richer, saltier flavors, while women lean toward milder, homier tastes.

On the other hand, the most disliked dishes show a more complex pattern.

| Men’s Most Hated         | Women’s Most Hated        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Jellied eels (42%)      | Liver and onion (47%)     |
| Liver and onion (38%)   | Black pudding (43%)       |
| Kippers (30%)           | Jellied eels (43%)        |

Jellied eels are a nightmare for both genders, with over 40% disliking them. Liver and onion also appears on both lists, but the dislike rate differs by nearly 10% between men and women.

As for black pudding, men like it 18% more than women, and women dislike it 15% more than men, making it the most divisive dish between the sexes. Dining with the opposite gender? Watch out for this one!

A few other dishes also show large gender gaps in approval:

- Steak and kidney pie: Men like it 17% more than women
- Steak and kidney pudding: Men like it 16% more than women
- Pork pie: Women dislike it 13% more than men
- Cauliflower cheese: Women like it 14% more than men

Overall, British women are pickier about food than men:

- Women’s average approval rate: 55%; men’s: 60%
- Women’s average dislike rate: 21%; men’s: 16%

## Stop Complaining to Britons About British Food

To sum up with a bit of British sarcasm: Britons love their local food—they just dislike more dishes than they like. And if you’re serving black pudding or cauliflower cheese to someone of the opposite gender, maybe ask first. Of course, Sunday roast is always a safe bet.
