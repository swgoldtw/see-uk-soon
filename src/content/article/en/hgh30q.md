## A Contradictory Economic Picture

Despite the ongoing contraction of the UK labor market, wages continue to rise, creating a seemingly contradictory economic picture.

</div>

According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), over the past year, the UK has lost more than 103,000 jobs. Looking at the longer-term trend, since May 2022, the number of vacancies has continued to decline, now down about 4.3% compared to pre-pandemic levels, equivalent to 34,000 positions. Meanwhile, the growth in the number of employees has stagnated, with a 2% drop since 2023, on the verge of turning negative.

</div>

In contrast, wage trends tell a different story. Since March 2021, the annual growth rate of the UK median wage has remained above 5%. Even under high inflation, real wages have shown a recovery trend since November 2022, turning positive from April 2023. They have now returned to early 2022 levels, with increases ranging from 1% to 2.5%.

## Who's Getting the Biggest Raises?

</div>

Looking closer at wage changes across industries, as of this April, the accommodation and food services sector saw the highest wage growth, with retail also above the overall median. In contrast, sectors like research, finance & insurance, and information & communication had lower increases. However, looking back to April a year ago, finance, insurance, and information & communication had wage growth on par with accommodation and food services, all exceeding 8%. This highlights the volatility in wage performance in these traditionally attractive sectors for international white-collar talent over the past two years.

## Possible Reasons

For this phenomenon of "job losses but rising wages," media and research institutions have offered various explanations. The Financial Times points out that significant increases in the minimum wage play a key role in overall wage data, and the slower growth in low-wage jobs compared to high-wage ones has pulled up the average wage. Economist Greg Thwaites approaches it from a labor supply and demand perspective, suggesting that many unemployed people are not actively seeking work, so job seekers do not need to lower their wage expectations. Additionally, with prices continuing to rise, workers are more inclined to seek higher-paying jobs to counter inflation, and productivity growth gives companies more room to raise wages, helping them stay competitive and retain talent.

## Where Did the Extra Money Go?

</div>

Has this extra purchasing power been spent? According to ONS data, since Q3 2022, the UK household savings rate has climbed from 6.1% to 12% in Q4 2024. In other words, most of the additional income has been saved rather than spent. In fact, since Q2 2022, total household spending has barely changed, indicating that even with wage growth, UK households remain cautious and conservative in their spending habits.

These intertwined trends together form the complex current landscape of the UK economy.
